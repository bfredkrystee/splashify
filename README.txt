1.0 OVERVIEW
-------------
Splashify is a full featured splash page module that is designed to be search
engine friendly. It is originally based on the Drupal 6 Splash module. It
allows you to specify a page to be displayed anywhere on your site, using one
of a few different delivery options (redirect, popup window or ColorBox). The
module also provides options specific to mobile devices.

The main focus of this module is the following:
- Be search engine friendly by redirecting via JavaScript (when applicable).
- Allow specific options for mobile devices.
- Allow different ways in delivering the splash page.
- Use ColorBox for displaying the splash page in a lightbox.
- You can have the system pick from a random list of splash pages, have a
list of splash pages show up in a specified order, display the specified
text/html in the site template or display the text/html full screen.
