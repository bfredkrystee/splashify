Fixed an issue with the sequential option when using the lightbox. It was
hitting the JS code in the drupal.behaviours attach twice. Wrapped all of
the JS code in a .load to prevent this from happening.

Did some testing with caching the JS and testing to see if modifying the
drupal cache settings break the splash page. Discovered that setting "Cache
pages for anonymous users" would break the splash functionality. But
aggregating the JS code did not break the splash page.

Issue #1425392 by klausi: Re-worked the JS and applied some major changes

- Surrounded some output text that I missed with the t() function.
- Took out the help text from the main config page and included it in
hook_help(). This is in the .module file that was in the previous commit.
- Took out some basic JavaScript and put it into a separate JS file.
- Took out using the filter_xss() function where it was needed.
- Simplified a few if statements.
- I re-wrote the whole splash display mechanism. All of the JavaScript is now
in a separate file and we send drupal settings variables to use in the JS. This
makes the JS much easier to maintain and debug. This required a lot of
re-working in the splashify_init() function.

Fixed issue #1430676. The problem was not happening on my local server, but was
happening on my dev server. Fixed the problem by putting the JS call in the
<head> after the colorbox js/css is included.

the system already created.
